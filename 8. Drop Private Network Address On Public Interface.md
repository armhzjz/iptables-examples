# 8. Drop Private Network Address On Public Interface

IP spoofing is nothing but to stop the following IPv4 address ranges for private networks on your public interfaces. Packets with non-routable source addresses should be rejected using the following syntax:
```
# iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j DROP
# iptables -A INPUT -i eth1 -s 10.0.0.0/8 -j DROP
```
## 8.1. IPv4 Address Ranges For Private Networks (make sure you block them on public interface)
 * 10.0.0.0/8 -j (A)
 * 172.16.0.0/12 (B)
 * 192.168.0.0/16 (C)
 * 224.0.0.0/4 (MULTICAST D)
 * 240.0.0.0/5 (E)
 * 127.0.0.0/8 (LOOPBACK)
