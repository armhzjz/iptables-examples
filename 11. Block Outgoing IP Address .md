# 11. Block Outgoing IP Address

To block outgoing traffic to a particular host or domain such as cyberciti.biz, enter:
```
# host -t a cyberciti.biz
```
Sample outputs:
```
cyberciti.biz has address 75.126.153.206
```
Note down its ip address and type the following to block all outgoing traffic to 75.126.153.206:
```
# iptables -A OUTPUT -d 75.126.153.206 -j DROP
```
You can use a subnet as follows:
```
# iptables -A OUTPUT -d 192.168.1.0/24 -j DROP
# iptables -A OUTPUT -o eth1 -d 192.168.1.0/24 -j DROP
```
## 11.1. Example - Block Facebook.com Domain

First, find out all ip address of facebook.com, enter:
```
# host -t a www.facebook.com
```
Sample outputs:
```
www.facebook.com has address 69.171.228.40
```
Find CIDR for 69.171.228.40, enter:
```
# whois 69.171.228.40 | grep CIDR
```
Sample outputs:
```
CIDR:           69.171.224.0/19
```
To prevent outgoing access to www.facebook.com, enter:
```
# iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d 69.171.224.0/19 -j DROP
```

You can also use domain name, enter:
```
# iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d www.facebook.com -j DROP
# iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -d facebook.com -j DROP
```
From the iptables man page:

>    ... specifying any name to be resolved with a remote query such as DNS (e.g., facebook.com is a really bad idea), a network IP address (with /mask), or a plain IP address ...
